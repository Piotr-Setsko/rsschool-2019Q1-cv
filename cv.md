Summary:
I have always been attracted to web development.
During school years, I tried to make simple presentation pages with blinking text.
While studying at the university, I studied how to make small websites with a couple of pages with using styles.
After studying, I forgot for a while about my interest in layout. But in trying to find myself and the work of my dreams, I returned to it again.
At the moment I am actively learning and trying to improve my level at frontend development in order to further connect my life with this profession.

Skills:
- confident knowledge of HTML5, CSS3
- basic knowledge of JavaScript
- experience cross-browser (IE11 +, Chrome, Firefox, Opera) and adaptive layout
- Experience working with graphic editors (Adobe Photoshop, Zeplin)
- Experience with CSS preprocessors (LESS, SASS)
- Possession of browser-based development tools (Chrome DevTools, Firefox Developer Tools)
- use of version control systems (Git)
- Experience in using project assembly tools (Grunt, Gulp)
